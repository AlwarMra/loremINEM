# Lorem INEM Ipsum

Visual Studio Code snippet extension Lorem INEM Ipsum. Its main goal is to remind junior coders that we all thought nobody would hire us, Lorem INEM Ipsum summarizes some of those highlights.


## Usage

To use the snippet open a HTML and start typing `inem`, `inem 2` or `inem 3` for one, two or three INEM paragraphs, respectively. It is also possible to print out up to 15 lorem INEM words by just typing `lorem[n]`, e.g., `lorem5` would return a five words sentence. Nothing you have not seen with emmet already.
